# ion-friction
This is the 1D1V PIC code used for ion friction calculation. Creation date: 4/23/2018

This code uses the acceleration derived from the Navier-Stokes equation to calculate
the velocity distribution in a dual-species ultracold neutral plasma. We add an
ion friction term to describe the interaction between the Ca and Yb ions. Initial
versions of the code used a constant term for the Coulomb logarithm.
